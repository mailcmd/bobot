<h1>Bobot bot builder</h1>

## Bobot, a tool not suitable for lazy people

With Bobot YOU are the smart one, YOU are the one who thinks, YOU are the one who solves problems,
and YOU are the one who creates solutions. Yes dude!... with Bobot there is not AIs, no prompts, 
no visual interfaces designed for people who cannot type because their nail polish chips or faggy 
stuff like that, here YOU are the one who has to work. With Bobot YOU must type the instructions 
that says to the bot what to do. 

But it's not all that hard with Bobot because, through simple and fairly self-explanatory language, 
you can instruct complex behavior without getting bogged down in the details of how it should be 
done.

## A simple language for doing complex things

Bobot is made in Elixir programing language and define a DSL (Domain Specific Language) to program 
bots creating an abstraction layer that allow to do a lot with a little. Like the DSL is made in 
Elixir it is also dependant of its syntax rules. So, although you does not need to be an Elixir 
expert, it is important to know al least a little about the fundamentals of Elixir language.
